# Misc

This is a collection of lab assignments that don't fall into any other category. Also, here we could have generic excercises, i.e. benchmarks and workloads which suffer from multiple performance bottlenecks, for example binary search. Here are some ideas what could be covered here:

* Various data-driven transformations, e.g. [this](https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/11/22/data-driven-tuning-specialize-switch) or [this](https://easyperf.net/blog/2019/11/27/data-driven-tuning-specialize-indirect-call).
* [Cache warming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzRxikGgaHI).
* Processing denormal FP values is [slow](https://easyperf.net/blog/2018/11/08/Using-denormal-floats-is-slow-how-to-detect-it).
* [Computed go-to](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/07/12/computed-goto-for-efficient-dispatch-tables).

**Work in progress...**

Let us know if you have any suggestion for a new lab assignment.
