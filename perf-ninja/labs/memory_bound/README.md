This is a collection of labs with performance bound by memory accesses. Here are some of the topics we plan to cover:

* Access data sequentially (loop interchange)
* Array-Of-Structures to Structures-Of-Arrays and back
* Packing and padding the data
* Grouping hot data
* Optimizing dynamic memory allocation (custom allocators)
* Software memory prefetching
* Optimizing for DTLB (utilizing large pages)

**Work in progress...**

Let us know if you have any suggestion for a new lab assignment.
