# FrontEnd Bound

This is a collection of labs with performance bound by the CPU FrontEnd. Here are some of the topics we plan to cover:

* Basic Block reordering (using builtin_expect)
* Basic Block placement (loop alignment)
* Using Link-Time (LTO) and Profile-Guided (PGO) Optimizations
* Optimizing for ITLB (utilizing large pages)

**Work in progress...**

Let us know if you have any suggestion for a new lab assignment.
